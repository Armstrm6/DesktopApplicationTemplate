# Agent Instructions

- Before beginning any task, review `CollaborationGuidelines.txt`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/CollaborationAndDebugTips.txt`, and any relevant `AGENTS.md` files to gather context and instructions.
- `CollaborationGuidelines.txt` provides collaboration practices, while `docs/CollaborationAndDebugTips.txt` is a running log of what worked, what broke, and why.
- Update those documents when your changes add context or new guidance.
- After modifying code, attempt to run `dotnet test` with `tests.runsettings` and share the results; if the environment lacks Windows desktop support, note the limitation and rely on CI.
