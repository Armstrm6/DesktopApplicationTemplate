### Changed
- Removing a service also deletes its columns from the CSV list and resets the output file.
- Clarified environment instruction precedence in `AGENTS.md`.
- Renamed root `CollaborationAndDebugTips.txt` to `CollaborationGuidelines.txt` and clarified distinction from `docs/CollaborationAndDebugTips.txt`.
- Updated `global.json` to require the .NET 8 SDK version `8.0.404`.
- Default `AutoStart` is now disabled and all environment configuration files set `"AutoStart": false`.
- CI workflow now runs on pushes to `feature/**` and `bugfix/**` branches and supports manual triggers, ensuring tests execute on GitHub.
- CI workflow skips checks for pull requests targeting the `dev` branch to speed up integration.
- `MqttCreateServiceView`, `MqttTagSubscriptionsView`, and `MqttEditConnectionView` along with their view models are now registered as transient services.
- `self-heal` workflow now monitors the unified `CI` pipeline.
- MQTT create, edit, and subscription views now follow design spacing with shared form styles and accessibility names.
- `TcpServiceViewModel` now evaluates scripts asynchronously and streamlined server toggle logging.
- Refactored `MqttService` with a single options-based constructor, clean reconnect logic, and consolidated publish methods.
- Extracted `IMessageRoutingService`, removed legacy `Route` API, and improved thread-safe message tracking with optional logging.
- Simplified `MqttServiceViewModel` to use `MqttServiceOptions` for settings and delegate token resolution to `MessageRoutingService`.
- `MqttService` and `MqttServiceViewModel` now consume `IOptions<MqttServiceOptions>` and the direct singleton registration was removed.
- Added a DI container test ensuring the service provider builds with MQTT components.
- Service creation now presents service types as icon bubbles and auto-generates default names upon selection.
- Main window routes MQTT service creation through a dedicated create view and opens the tag subscriptions view after setup. Editing an existing MQTT service now uses the connection edit view and persists updated options.
- Reordered test-message controls above the topic list in `MqttTagSubscriptionsView` and aligned margins with design guidance.
- MQTT service creation now occurs within the main window frame and returns to the previous view after completion, removing the popup window dependency.
- Service context menus invoke a new `EditServiceCommand`; editing an MQTT service opens the connection view with current options preloaded.
- `ServiceViewModel` now holds `TcpServiceOptions` so each TCP service retains its own configuration when persisted.
- Consolidated `MqttTagSubscriptionsViewModel` to a single subscription collection and unified topic properties.
- Simplified `MqttTagSubscriptionsView` layout, removing duplicate controls and redundant namespace declarations.

### Removed
- Placeholder "Desktop Template" text from the navigation bar.
- Legacy GitHub workflows (`dotnet.yml`, `dotnet-desktop-ci.yml`, `ci.yml`).
- Unused `RichTextLogger` service and installer `CustomControl1` control.
- `PublishTopic` and `PublishMessage` fields from `MqttServiceViewModel`.
- Standalone `FilterWindow` in favor of inline filter popup.

### Fixed
- Corrected logo resource path so the image renders in the navigation bar.
 - Service creation and renaming now append numeric suffixes to avoid duplicate names.
- Updated GitHub workflows to install the WPF workload instead of the deprecated windowsdesktop workload.
- MQTT service now disconnects before reconnecting when settings change.
- Removed obsolete MQTT options model that caused duplicate property definitions.
- Updated MQTT service for new WebSocket configuration API and client certificate handling.
- Replaced unsupported information-level logs with debug logs in message routing components.
- Corrected `AppSettings` namespace to ensure configuration binding compiles.
- Fixed missing `AppSettings` references in startup services.
- Adjusted MQTT view model tests to return typed MQTTnet results instead of `Task.CompletedTask`, preventing build failures when APIs return generic tasks.
- Removed obsolete `MQTTnet.Client.Publishing` import in MQTT view model tests to resolve missing namespace build errors.
- Guarded CSV viewer configuration serialization to prevent stack overflow when saving empty data.
- Main window sizes to content so UI elements are no longer clipped at the edges.
- Service creation now prompts for a service type instead of defaulting to MQTT.
- CSV logging rotates to a new indexed file when services are removed without deleting existing output.
- Empty CSV configuration files no longer cause JSON parsing errors.
- Logging minimum level changes now re-filter existing log entries without reloading from disk.
- Added missing `FluentAssertions` package reference to the test project and documented dependency checks to avoid build failures.
- Service and settings persistence now ignore reference cycles during JSON serialization to avoid stack overflow when saving configuration.
- CSV service now increments file index only when `FileNamePattern` contains `{index}`.
- Added tests confirming the main view ignores non-Escape key presses and service persistence handles cyclical references.
- Eliminated recursive logging in CSV service to prevent stack overflow and added guards that capture configuration snapshots on save failures.
- Removed invalid `MouseDoubleClick` XAML handler and cleaned up ambiguous WPF references causing build failures.
- Host validation now accepts domain names for all services, preventing connection errors when using non-IP hosts.
- Corrected service count bindings to use one-way mode, preventing runtime errors on read-only properties.
- Resolved WPF build error by removing duplicate StackPanel from `MqttCreateServiceView` so the page hosts a single `ScrollViewer`.
- Added missing `MQTTnet.Protocol` using in `MqttCreateServiceViewModel` to restore `MqttQualityOfServiceLevel` references.
- Removed obsolete MQTT service view and dialog-based edit calls that broke build-time helper resolution.
- Aligned `AsyncRelayCommand` namespace with Helpers folder.
- Replaced preview Microsoft.Extensions.* package references with stable 8.0 versions and renamed test variables to eliminate duplicate declarations.
- Addressed build failures by upgrading logging abstractions, exposing MQTT connect helpers, removing duplicate subscribe implementations, and initializing non-null fields.
- Fixed ObjectDataProvider bindings in `MqttTagSubscriptionsView` to prevent runtime `ArgumentException` and restored send button accessibility metadata.
- Eliminated duplicate Style assignments in `MqttEditConnectionView` to prevent XAML parse failures.
- Cleaned up `CollaborationAndDebugTips.txt` by removing duplicate headers and restoring log structure.
- CSV creator no longer adds columns for itself or other CSV services, preventing self-referencing entries.
- Application now releases keyboard state on shutdown to prevent stuck R, D, and Q keys.
