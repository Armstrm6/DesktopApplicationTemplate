# Collaboration & Debug Tips (Codex <-> Matt)
Purpose: Running log of what worked, what broke, and why.

## How to Log
- Keep a single block per topic or feature.
- To expand an existing topic, update its block instead of creating a new one.
- Append commit hashes or PR numbers to the **Related Commits/PRs** line as work continues.
- Use `tools/add-tip.ps1` with the same `-Topic` value to generate a block, then merge it into the existing entry.
- Always record environment limitations (e.g., missing dotnet runtime).

[2025-08-27 04:05] Topic: Documentation restructuring
Context: Grouped changelog entries under feature headings and clarified topic-based logging.
Observations: CHANGELOG now organizes items by feature; collaboration tips emphasize one block per topic.
Codex Limitations noticed: PowerShell unavailable; appended tips manually.
Effective Prompts / Instructions that worked: User request to clarify docs and logging.
Decisions & Rationale: Improve readability and future contributions.
Action Items: none

[2025-08-27 04:00] Topic: Service rule and screen abstractions
Context: Introduced IServiceRule/IServiceScreen services and refactored CSV and FTP create view models to use them.
Observations: Validation and screen events are centralized, reducing duplication across service workflows.
Codex Limitations noticed: Linux container lacks WindowsDesktop runtime; dotnet test cannot run.
Effective Prompts / Instructions that worked: Followed AGENTS guidelines for DI and tests.
Decisions & Rationale: Promote reuse and consistent screen behavior.
Action Items: Monitor CI for Windows-specific issues.

[2025-08-27 03:58] Topic: File search service
Context: Added cached async file search integrated with File Observer to load image names through DI.
Observations: Service caches `Directory.EnumerateFiles` results to speed lookups; view model loads names via DI.
Codex Limitations noticed: dotnet test fails to build on Linux due to WPF dependencies.
Effective Prompts / Instructions that worked: User request to centralize file enumeration.
Decisions & Rationale: Provide reusable async search to support File Observer features.
Action Items: Validate on Windows CI.

[2025-08-27 02:57] Topic: Test reliability and service persistence
Context: Stabilized failing tests by ensuring options reload, awaiting file writes, and isolating static settings.
Observations: Added directory creation before saving, restored TCP options, registered pack URI, and ran settings sequentially.
Codex Limitations noticed: dotnet CLI unavailable; tests rely on CI.
Effective Prompts / Instructions that worked: AGENTS guidance on async/await and DI-safe constructors.
Decisions & Rationale: Ensure deterministic tests and reliable service persistence.
Action Items: Monitor CI for Windows-specific failures.

[2025-08-26 18:51] Topic: MQTT service enhancements
Context: Consolidated subscription view, added connection editor, will options, per-topic QoS, and advanced settings.
Observations: View models expose a single subscriptions collection, support per-topic QoS, and visualize subscribe results.
Codex Limitations noticed: Linux environment cannot render WPF; dotnet test unavailable.
Effective Prompts / Instructions that worked: Follow AGENTS for MVVM and DI.
Decisions & Rationale: Simplify MQTT workflow and ensure options propagate to client.
Action Items: Verify UI behavior on Windows CI.

[2025-08-26 12:00] Topic: Service creation navigation
Context: Embedded service creation flows in the main window and added navigation helpers with tests.
Observations: Double-clicking entries opens edit views; main window hosts service creation, removing separate window.
Codex Limitations noticed: dotnet CLI missing; rely on CI.
Effective Prompts / Instructions that worked: User request to streamline navigation.
Decisions & Rationale: Keep workflows within main window and validate navigation via tests.
Action Items: Confirm via CI.

[2025-08-26 11:00] Topic: FTP service fixes
Context: Resolved service selection freeze, added cancel support, and fixed edit view constructor.
Observations: FTP create/edit views preload options, close correctly, and constructor guards against null view model.
Codex Limitations noticed: Linux environment lacks WindowsDesktop runtime; tests rely on CI.
Effective Prompts / Instructions that worked: Review build errors and follow DI guidelines.
Decisions & Rationale: Improve FTP UX and ensure DI-friendly constructors.
Action Items: Monitor CI for regressions.
