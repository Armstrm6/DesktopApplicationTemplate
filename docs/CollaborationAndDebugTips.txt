Observations: Simplifies testing and removes static logger state.
Codex Limitations noticed: Unable to execute Windows-specific tests in container.
Effective Prompts / Instructions that worked: n/a
Decisions & Rationale: Use DI to share single logging service and helpers.
Action Items: Monitor CI for Windows-specific behaviors.

[2025-08-13 17:52] Topic: Logo resource path fix
Context: Navigation bar logo failed to render because image path was relative to the view folder.
Observations: Using a root-relative path loads the embedded image correctly.

[2025-08-13 18:09] Topic: CI runs on feature branches
Context: Enabled GitHub Actions to execute tests on pushes to `feature/**` and `bugfix/**` branches.
Observations: Codex can push code to trigger remote tests without local execution.
Codex Limitations noticed: `dotnet test` cannot run `net8.0-windows` tests on Linux.
Effective Prompts / Instructions that worked: Configuring push patterns and `workflow_dispatch`.
Decisions & Rationale: Use GitHub-hosted runners to centralize validation.
Action Items: Monitor CI runs for unexpected failures.
